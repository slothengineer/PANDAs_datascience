# README

## Introduction

This repository contains code that utilizes the **Pandas library** for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas is a powerful Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, making it a popular choice for data scientists, analysts, and engineers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pandas library (install via `pip install pandas`)

It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated from other projects.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pandas-code.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd pandas-code
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if not done already, see Prerequisites):

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Overview of Code

The code in this repository demonstrates various functionalities of the Pandas library, including:

1. **Data Loading**: How to read data from different file formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for handling missing values, data imputation, and data transformation.

3. **Data Manipulation**: How to filter, sort, and group data based on specific criteria.

4. **Data Analysis**: Examples of calculating summary statistics, aggregations, and applying mathematical operations.

5. **Data Visualization**: Basic data visualization using Pandas and other compatible visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
